# Anki-Decks
A repository for the Anki Decks created by Alex van Morren

Hey all and welcome to the PNWU Anki-Deck repository. 
The images are of my Add-ons (Image Occlusion Enhanced is required!) and deck Options.
The decks are designed such that you should initially suspended all cards, then un-suspended the respective deck at intervals you see fit (i.e., a week before discussion, three days before, etc.).
Don't hesitate to let me know if there are errors or things that should be adjusted.

Enjoy and happy Ankining =]
